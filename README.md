ArtemisMidiKontrol
==================

Helper application to allow you to use external MIDI input devices as controllers for the Artemis game

To use this with Korg's nanoKONTROL2, you need to do two things:

1. Put the controller into CC mode, by holding down the SET and CYCLE buttons while plugging it in
2. Change LEDs to 'External' mode instead of internal, using the Korg Kontrol Editor software
